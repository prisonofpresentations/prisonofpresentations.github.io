						<p>Xanadu is as much of a concept as it was a stab at the future of
							hypertext. The promise of a
							centralized system consisting of purely original and referenceable documents that is open to
							everyone was too ahead of its time, and was inadequately executed. ​</p>
						<p> importance of its downfall comes from what it teaches us about society.
							The lack of
							organization caused the company to pivot in multiple directions every time a new idea arose.
							The lack of developing an outward company face crippled their value. However most
							importantly, being able to codify all the information in the world both reliably and in an
							infinitely scalable way, is near impossible.</p>
						<p> As suspected by Jellinghaus, who was one of the younger members of the
							Xanadu team, "human
							society might not benefit from a perfect technological memory. Thinking is based on
							selection and weeding out; remembering everything is strangely similar to forgetting
							everything
						</p>
						<strong>W H Y N O T X A N A D U</strong>
						<p>The internet as we see it today and society as a whole thrives having
							personal freedom to do
							what you want. From editing images and branding them as your own meme to plagiarizing your
							6th grade history essay, people like creating, and sharing. In a diametrically opposing
							sense, Xanadu was meant to label each piece of work and always link back to the original
							creator - In the architects' eyes, "A universal democratic library... a tool for rational
							discussion...An idea would never become detached from its author...freeze the chaotic flow
							of knowledge and grasp the lines of connection and influence"</p>
						<p>Additionally, people appreciate the simple things and ease of use in the
							products they use.
							Xanadu throughout its ups and downs (many downs) never kept its focus on appearance but
							rather pure concept, and a company cannot thrive on a concept.​</p>
						<p>Even someone like an Engineer that might appreciate the order and ease of
							finding technical
							papers via Xanadu would likely prefer the modern internet for everyday use.</p>
						<strong>O R D E R A N D C H A O S</strong>

						<p>The justoposition of order and chaos play a crutial role in Nelson's
								vision. For him, the world is a chaotic mess where every unique thought has to be documented. Gary Wolf (the interviewer in teh WIRED article) recalled,	“Nelson records everything and remembers nothing. Xanadu was to have been his cure.". As if the universe were playing a cruel joke on Nelson, Xanadu ended up being the biggest pain in his side. The choas that arose working on the project even diverged the company to a point where Nelson had to fight for his original company back. It is almost as if trying to create order out of chaos led to even more chaos.</p>

						<strong>A P E R F E C T R E A L I T Y</strong>
						<p>Ted Nelson seems to go about creating Xanadu as a perfect way for people to interact and
							absorb media, but very few people understand what he really means. Ted Nelson came up with
							this idea before operating systems were invented, before Microsoft and Apple, before DOS and
							Unix and certainly before the world wide web.</p>

						<p>Althrough Project Xanadu never caught along </p>
						<strong>P R I S I O N O F P A P E R</strong>
						<p>In an interview, he stated that back in the 60's, his concept was to rival even the best
							hypertext platforms of the time. Reading text should be not about how we have always read,
							from page to page, but about being able to read in an inifinte source. Nelson throught was
							confused by all the corporations developing apps to replicate books and page style reading
							when they could be making better use of their time creating software fit for a computer.</p>

						<strong>Q U E S T I O N S</strong>

						<ul>
							<li>Do you want Xanadu to exist? If so, would you use it?</li>
							<li>Could Ted Nelson be considered one of the original conceptualizers of the internet?</li>
							<li>If so what ideas of his made it to the internet as we see it today.</li>
							<li>Can there be chaos through order?</li>
							<li>Nelson envisions 2 ways for hypertext to be read, can you think of any other?</li>
